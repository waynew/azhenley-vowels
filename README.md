This repo contains the code and results from benchmarking 11 different methods of detecting a vowel in a string. The full write up: [The fastest way to detect a vowel in a string](https://austinhenley.com/blog/vowels.html).

Set the parameters of the benchmark then run it with `python3 vowels_benchmark.py`. It gets slow after 2000 strings of length 1000.
